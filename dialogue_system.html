        <p class="alltext ptext">
            The Dialogue System was made to be simple to use, easy to set up in-engine, and provide features like localization, triggers, input handling, and most importantly—dialogue. 
            I also wanted dialogue to be branchable and easy to edit. I could have settled on a predefined file format like JSON, but I realized that made dialogues hard to write and read. 
            So I decided to create an interpreter for the Crabs Dialogue Language. It's a simple instruction language but robust enough to be upgraded in the future. 
            The interpreter supports instances, allowing multiple dialogues to run at once.
        </p>

        <a href="dialogue_system_language.html" class="alltext ptext">
            The specifications for the dialogue language are provided below. With that, you have everything you need to start creating your own stories and characters. 
            (Well, that and the use of the wrapper framework.)
        </a>

        <p class="alltext ptext">
            For those interested in building their own wrappers—or just curious—I'll now provide an overview of how the dialogue system works. 
            First things first: it's important to understand that the system operates across multiple layers.
        </p>

        <img />

        <p class="alltext ptext">
            The first layer is the <strong>System Layer</strong>. This serves as the foundation and holds data like the current locale and the root folder for all dialogues. 
            It also contains the next layer.
        </p>

        <p class="alltext ptext">
            The second layer is the <strong>Dialogue Cache Layer</strong>. This is where dialogues are loaded based on their directory. 
            You can preload all dialogues in a directory, unload them, or reload them. These operations happen on a separate thread, and dialogues are only saved after execution finishes. 
            Keep in mind that this isn't true parallelism—it processes tasks sequentially on a different thread to avoid slowing down the game loop. 
            This decision was made to avoid race conditions with multiple cache operations. 
            To achieve this semi-parallelism, the <code>TaskQueue</code> class from Crabs Additions is used. 
            Currently, the Dialogue Cache Layer is implemented as a dictionary, but I plan to remake it using a trie-based structure.
        </p>

        <p class="alltext ptext">
            The third layer is the <strong>Dialogue Stack Layer</strong>. This represents a single loaded folder of dialogues. 
            (This might change in the future with the introduction of Trie Cache, which could make this layer fully virtual.)
        </p>

        <p class="alltext ptext">
            The fourth layer is the <strong>Dialogue Layer</strong>. Here, the dialogue holds header information and a flag indicating whether it's initialized. 
            It also contains its own unique instance of the interpreter.
        </p>

        <p class="alltext ptext">
            The fifth layer is the <strong>Dialogue Interpreter</strong>. This is the most important part. 
            Its job is to compile dialogue files into an internal format. 
            It stores information about branches—where they start, how long they are—and about commands/instructions. 
            These are extendable and simple to implement thanks to polymorphism. 
            It also tracks dialogue instances using the <code>Indexer</code> class from Crabs Additions and uses the <code>JSONSerializer</code> from Crabs Serializer for localization.
        </p>

        <p class="alltext ptext">
            The final layer is the <strong>Instance Layer</strong>. Users receive a handle to a specific dialogue instance from the interpreter. 
            With this handle, each instance can be treated independently. 
            It holds data like the current index, branch stack, registered triggers, variables, and execution flags.
        </p>

        <p class="alltext ptext">
            As you've probably noticed, there are plans to improve the system even further. 
            Right now, the system offers a simple and effective way to create and interpret dialogues, 
            but I believe there's still plenty of room for improvement.
