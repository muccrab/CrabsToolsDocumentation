    <p class="alltext ptext">
      <strong>Persi</strong> is the core card game played within the Crabs demo. The goal? Beat your opponent down to 0 health.

    <h3 class="alltext h2text">Basic Mechanics</h3>
    <ul class="alltext list">
      <li>Each card deals damage equal to its rank. For example, a 5 deals 5 damage. Max damage from a single card is 10.</li>
      <li>Cards are placed on "dumps" (think stacks or zones). When a new card is placed, it's considered in an <strong>attacking state</strong>.</li>
      <li>The opponent must respond by placing a matching card on top to block the attack:
        <ul>
          <li>Matching <strong>rank</strong> or <strong>suit</strong> is required to defend.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>If the defending player can't respond, they take the full damage from the card.</li>
      <li>After defending, the newly played card becomes the new attacker. It's an endless slap-fight until someone caves in.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="alltext h2text">Special Cards</h3>
    <p class="alltext ptext">
      Some cards come with spicy rules to mix up the game:
    </p>
    <ul class="alltext list">
      <li><strong>Ace (any suit):</strong> When attacking, can only be defended with another Ace.</li>
      <li><strong>Seven (any suit):</strong> Deals <strong>double damage</strong> when played. If stacked on top of another Seven, the damage just keeps getting better, because the multiplier keeps on rising.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="alltext ptext">
      That's the gist. It's a fast-paced, rule-light, damage-focused card game.
